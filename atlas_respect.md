# Respect for Author & Framing

This project is a technical exploration inspired by the spirit of Don D. M. Tadaya’s
*The Prompt Atlas*. The prompts and system instructions deliberately echo the book’s
emphasis on co-authorship, breadth across domains (profit/purpose, creativity/myth,
science, psychology), and the invitation to ask better questions.

We do not reproduce proprietary text. We reference themes and give explicit attribution.
