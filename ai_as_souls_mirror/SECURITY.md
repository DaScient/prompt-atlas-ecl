# Security & Privacy

- This prototype is **local-first**; by default it makes **no outbound network calls**.
- Avoid storing sensitive personal data. If you add persistence, encrypt at rest and redact on screen.
- Never present reflections as diagnosis; keep copy non-directive and compassionate.
- If you integrate a cloud LLM, document exactly what is sent and provide a local opt-out.
